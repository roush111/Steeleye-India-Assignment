  1.  Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript. Let us see how we transform Lists in regular JavaScript. The map() function is used for traversing the lists. In the below example, the map() function takes an array of numbers and multiply their values with 5. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable multiplyNums and log it. A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists. In React, map() can be used to generate lists. Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript. To provide a unique identity to each list element from lists. To remove the warning or error that react throw if the key is not used. It is used to identify which items have changed, updated, or deleted from the Lists.
  2.  We receive some interesting problems every now and then but most of the asked questions are for common problems. This article provides detailed instructions for 15 common problems that a beginner React.js learner might make. 
a)  Not Starting a Component Name with a Capital Letter : A React component must have a name which starts with a capital letter. If the component name does not start with a capital letter, the component use will be treated as a built-in element such as a div or span.
b)  Using Single Quotes Instead of Back-ticks
Strings created with back-ticks (`…​`) are different from strings created with single quotes ('…​').
c)  Using React.PropTypes
The PropTypes object was removed from React. It used to be available as React.PropTypes but you cannot use that anymore. Instead, you need to Add the new prop-types package to your project: npm install prop-types Import it: import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
